# - Strings which are not entire sentences, see the maintainer guidelines

# - Strings which use unclear terms or require additional context to be
#   understood.
# - Strings which make invalid assumptions about notation of date, time or
#   money.
# - Pluralisation problems.
# - Incorrect English spelling.
# - Incorrect formatting.
# It can be your email address, or a mailing list address where translators
# can write to without being subscribed, or the URL of a web page through
# which the translators can contact you.
